# Python-SnakeGame
Welcome to the Python Snake Game! This is a classic arcade-style game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

How to Play
Run the snake_game.py script using Python 3.
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
The snake will automatically move in the selected direction.
Your goal is to eat the food (appearing as a dot) to make the snake grow.
Be careful not to run into the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
